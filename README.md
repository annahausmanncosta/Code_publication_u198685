Nowadays, optimization techniques are playing an increasingly significant role in various domains, including molecular chemistry, material strength, and robotics, among others. These fields often require the search and optimization of solutions that evolve in complex, non-linear ways. To tackle such problems, evolutionary algorithms have emerged as adaptive methods of choice. These algorithms draw inspiration from Darwin's theory of evolution and operate on a population of potential solutions. By employing evolutionary computation, the population evolves by generating new solutions that outperform previous generations. The individual's representation is encoded using genes [1].

In line with these ideas, I propose an algorithm based on self-adaptation. This algorithm begins with a selection process and Gaussian mutation. After a certain number of generations, it identifies the individual with the highest fitness based on their "genotype" consisting of two genes. This code was developed within the context of the algorithms subject.
