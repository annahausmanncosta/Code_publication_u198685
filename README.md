Nowadays, optimization techniques are increasingly being used in various fields such as molecular chemistry, material strength, and robotics, among others, where the need arises to search for and optimize solutions that evolve in a non-linear manner. Evolutionary algorithms are adaptive methods used to solve such problems. These algorithms draw inspiration from Darwin's theory of evolution and rely on a population of potential solutions. Through evolutionary computation, the population expands by generating new solutions that improve upon previous generations. Genes are used to encode the representation of an individual [1].

I propose an algorithm based on self-adaptation which, starting from a selection and Gaussian mutation, after x generations selects the individu with the best fittest based on the "genotype" composed of two genes.Code made in algorithms subject.
